# Team Roster & Lineup

## Roster & Lineup

### Each team consists of `r roster_spots` roster spots and will submit a valid lineup each week of the regular and postseason that consists of `r sum(lineup$starting_spots)` starting players.

#### A valid starting lineup consists of the following
    
#### The only exception to this rule is benching a player to ensure a win for your team.
    
##### For example your opponent's team is done and you are winning by 1 point with only your kicker left to play. It is acceptable to bench your kicker to guarantee a win.
    
### There will not be a limit to the number of players at each position a team can have on their roster.

### Limitations will not be placed on the “drop player” status for any players.

    booktabs = TRUE
    )

```    




## Injured Reserve Slot

### Each team will have `r ir_spots` IR slot separate from their roster that may only be filled by a player designated by the host platform to be IR eligible.

#### This will not count against a teams `r roster_spots`-man roster

## Submitting Weekly Roster

### Individual players on a team roster will be locked in at the start of each player’s game.

### If an owner wishes to make a lineup change and is physically unable to do so they may contact the commissioner to make the changes for them.

#### All calls to the commissioner must be made prior to lineup locks and cannot be undone once submitted by the commissioner.
  
##### If the commissioner is unavailable during this time the LOC will make the changes.
##### Both the Commissioner and LOC must notify the league of the adjustment(s), via the official TSU group message, prior to final submittal.
      
###### Text message is an acceptable form of communication and the recipient does not need to respond.
          
#### The commissioner or LOC are not responsible for guaranteeing changes.
