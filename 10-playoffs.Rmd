# Playoffs

## When

### The regular season of TSU will conclude with NFL week 13.

### The first week of TSU playoffs will be week 14 (TSU wildcard week).

### ESPN cannot accommodate our custom playoff structure, so the matchups will be set manually each week by the commissioner.  An up-to-date playoff bracket will be supplied to everyone during each week of the playoffs.

### Final season rankings for teams will be determined by their individual performances in the playoff structure that is outlined a drawn below.
