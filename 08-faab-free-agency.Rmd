# FAAB & Free Agency {#free-agency}

## Free Agency Acquisition Budget (FAAB)


### Players will become locked at the start of their respective game.

### Each team will start the season with an annual budget of $`r faab_budget` minus any subtractions from penalties during the draft. This will be the ONLY FAAB money owners will have for the entire season, including playoffs. 

### The weekly FAAB auction will be a silent auction with the player being awarded to the highest bidder.
#### In the event of a tie the player will be awarded to the team with the lower total points scored for the season. 

### The FAAB auction and the subsequent free agency period will follow the same timeline as ESPN standard leagues.
#### FAAB bids can be submitted at any time but will not be processed until 3:00 a.m. EST Thursday morning.
#### At 3:00 a.m. EST Thursday morning, players not bid on will be available for free agency pickup.
#### Players selected from free agency will not count against a teamâ€™s FAAB budget.


### The same process will be followed during the playoffs. Special priority will not be given to certain teams.

#### Accidental player drop - If a team owner accidentally drops a player to waivers they may ask to have the player added back to their roster if the following conditions are met:
##### There can not be any major news (news level up to commissioner's determination) involving the player within the 24 hour window
##### The commissioner must be notified of the situation within 24 hours of the player being dropped


#### The Senior Council must review and approve/veto each occurrence


#### The team owner must pay $10 FAAB or, if they have less than $10 FAAB, subtract 2 points from that weeks total points scored.
